# rpes_greenhouse

The project originates from a lab course namend "rapid prototyping" at Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences.
The goal is to create an affordable, small scale greenhouse for people with no time to manage plants.

We are hopefully able to use an arduino or sth. to control the whole thing because 
labview and the 8000 euro controller are not really a usefull solution
